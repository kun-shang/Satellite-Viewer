# [Satellite Viewer](http://go.osu.edu/orbit)

[Satellite Viewer](http://go.osu.edu/orbit) is an interactive toolbox for satellite orbit visualization, and designed for students learning about Earth satellite orbits, including existing and proposed courses, Earth Sci. 4310: Remote Sensing in Earth Sciences, and Geodetic Sci/Earth Sci. 2310: Sensing Planet Earth, at [The Ohio State University] (https://www.osu.edu). The toolbox runs an interactive web-based software that can visualize Earth orbiting satellites and their sampling on Earth, watching from space, or fixed on a point on Earth. Using [bing] (http://www.bing.com) map (Â©Microsoft) and other maps, users can visualize temporal and spatial coverage of various orbiting satellites. The toolbox uses the open-source JavaScript library from [Cesium] (https://cesiumjs.org/) and a portfolio theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
